# CPH-NG

CPH-NG (Competitive Programming Helper - Next Generation) is a **Visual Studio
Code (VS Code) extension** specifically developed for competitive programming.

CPH-NG empowers users to conveniently and efficiently **compile, run, and
judge** their programs directly within the VS Code environment.

!!! warning
    Until now, CPH NG supports C++ and Java only.

## What is CPH-NG?
